# Graffinity Neo4j

Python scripts for creating neo4j databases from marclab and flights data. The databases created with these scripts should be put into the \_data folder of the [graffinity_server](https://github.com/visdesignlab/graffinity_server).

Beware: this is pre-alpha software used for my own exploring and experimenting. 

## Flights

The create.py script creates a database with airports (nodes) connected by flights (edges).

## MarcLab

The create.py script creates a database with neurons (nodes) connected by synapses (edges).
